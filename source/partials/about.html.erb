    <h2>A little about me</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in Germany and moved to Japan in 2016. Before transitioning into tech this year, I was doing research on social inequalities as both an undergraduate student and later a research student at Yokohama National University in Yokohama, Japan.<br>
      In the future, I hope to connect the spaces of Computer Science and Sociology and leverage my technical skills to create social change.</p>
    <p>📍 Tokyo, Japan</p>
